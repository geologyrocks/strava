This app will connect to my Stava account and listen out for new activity submissions.

Activities that have a property VirtualRide will have their gear changed to Kickr Snap.

Hide real rides that are less than a certain number of miles, maybe 3 or 4?  To catch those pootles around Eastleigh.  Also assign Commute tag.

Also set the basemap to Pride each time.
